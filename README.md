# MyFirstApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.9.

This project is just a small practice for the activities contained in the Udemy angular course "the-complete-guide-to-angular-2".

Sometimes i will not do exactly what the task ask me to do, but i will do something similar and with the same goal and difficulty (or even harder), that make more sense with this template im building.

My final goal is to do something somehow usefull in the end of this course (i dont know what yet), but maybe at the end of the course I will have to create another repository just using what I've learned without reusing this code (don't know yet).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

### TASK 1

### TASK 2

### TASK 3

1 - create a button with says 'Display details'
2 - add a paragraph with any content of your choice (e.g: 'Secret password = tuna')
3 - Toggle the displaying of that paragraph with the button created in the first step
4 - Log all button clicks in an array and output that array below the secret paragraph (maybe log a timestamp or simply and incrementing number)
5 - Starting at the 5th log item, give all future log items a blue background (via ngStyle) and white color (via ngClass)
